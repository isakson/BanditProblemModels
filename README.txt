Computational Models of Congition
Final Project
11/13/2018

Code written by Irene Sakson and Ellie Mamantov as a final project for Computational Models of Cognition.

This folder contiains:

1. Five Python files with code for the five heuristic models and data analysis 
     - win_stay_lose_shift.py contains functions implementing Win-stay, lose-shift
     - epsilon_heuristics.py contains functions implementing Epsilon-greedy and Epsilon-decreasing
     - pi_first.py contains functions implementing Pi-First
     - tau_switch.py contains functions implementing Tau-Switch
     - data_analysis.py contains functions analyzing our data and Lee et al.'s (2011) data.
    
2. The directory ModelData, which contains directories for each model, with .csv data corresponding 
to each condition. The ModelData directory also contains the directory ModelAverages, which contains 
the text files with our analysis of the models' performances. 

3. The .txt files averages.txt and choices_data.txt, which contain analysis of the Lee et al. (2011) 
data. choices_data.txt includes the data for each participant, and averages.txt contains the data 
averaged across all 10 of Lee et al.'s (2011) participants.

4. The directory 6ArmData, which contains directories for each model, with .csv data. The 6ArmData directory also contains the directory Averages, which contains the text file with our analysis of the 
models' performances.
